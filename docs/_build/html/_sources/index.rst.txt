EmbASP
======

vai alle :doc:`FAQ <faq>`

A framework for the integration (embedding) of **Logic Programming** in external systems for generic applications.
It helps developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks by means of solvers on different platforms.

The framework can be implemented in a object-oriented programming language of choice, easing and guiding the generation of suitable libraries for the use of specific solvers on selected platforms.
We currently provide 3 implementations (in `Java <https://www.java.com>`_ , in `Python <https://www.python.org>`_ and in `C# <https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/>`_ ) 
and ready-made libraries for the embedding of the ASP (Answer Set Programming) solvers `DLV <http://www.dlvsystem.com/dlv>`_ , `DLV2 <https://www.mat.unical.it/DLV>`_ , `clingo <https://potassco.org/clingo>`_ , `DLVHEX <http://www.kr.tuwien.ac.at/research/systems/dlvhex/>`_ and the PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) cloud solver `Solver.Planning.Domains <http://solver.planning.domains>`_ (SPD) on the Desktop platform and of DLV and SPD on the Mobile (Android™) one (available only for the Java version).

However, the framework has been designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to different solvers and platforms.
It is worth to notice that solvers are invoked in different modes; for instance, SPD is invoked via a remote connection, while for the other, binaries are effectively embedded and natively executed.

Java implementation
===================

The following figure provides some details about classes and interfaces of the implementation.

.. figure:: _image/class_diagram_java_v6.png

Base module implementation
--------------------------

Each component in the **Base** module has been implemented by means of an abstract class, generic class or interface that will specialize in the following packages.

In particular, the **Handler** class collects **InputProgram** and **OptionDescriptor** objects communicated by the user.

For what the asynchronous mode is concerned, the interface **Service** depends from the interface **Callback**, since once the reasoning service has terminated, the result of the computation is returned back via a class **Callback**.

Platforms module implementation
-------------------------------

In order to support a new platform, the **Handler** and Service components must be adapted.

As for the Android platform, we developed an **AndroidHandler** that handles the execution of an **AndroidService**, which provides facilities to manage the execution of a solver on the Android platform.

Similarly, for the desktop platform we developed a **DesktopHandler** and a **DesktopService**, which generalizes the usage of a solver on the desktop platform, allowing both synchronous and asynchronous execution modes.

Languages module implementation
-------------------------------

This module includes specific classes for the management of input and output to ASP and PDDL solvers.

The **Mapper** component of the **Languages** module is implemented via a **Mapper** class, that allows to translate input and output into Java objects.
Such translations are guided by `ANTLR4 <https://www.antlr.org/>`_ library and `Java <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations>`_ Annotations, a form of metadata that mark Java code and provide information that is not part of the program itself: they have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

In our setting, we make use of such feature so that it is possible to translate facts into strings and vice-versa via two custom annotations, defined according to the following syntax:

* *@Id (string_name)*: the target must be a class, and defines the predicate name (in the ASP case) and the action name (in the PDDL case) the class is mapped to;
* *@Param (integer_position)*: the target must be a field of a class annotated via *@Id*, and defines the term (and its position) in the atom (in the ASP case) and in the action (in the PDDL case) the field is mapped to.

By means of the Java Reflection mechanisms, annotations are examined at runtime, and taken into account to properly define the translation.

If the classes intended for the translation are not annotated or not correctly annotated, an exception is raised.

In addition to the **Mapper**, this module features two sub-modules which are more strictly related to ASP and PDDL.

Specialization module Implementation
------------------------------------

The classes **DLVAnswerSets**, **DLV2AnswerSets**, **ClingoAnswerSets**, **DLVHEXAnswerSets** and **SPDPlan** implement specific extensions of the **AnswerSets** or **Plan** classes, in charge of manipulating the output of the respective solvers.

Moreover, this module can contain classes extending **OptionDescriptor** to implement specific options of the solver at hand.
