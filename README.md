# EmbASP website

Welcome! This repository houses all of the assets required to build the [EmbASP website](https://www.mat.unical.it/calimeri/projects/embasp/).

EmbASP is a framework for the integration (embedding) of **Logic Programming** in external systems for generic applications.
It helps developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks by means of solvers on different platforms.

You can find the current development version [here](https://github.com/DeMaCS-UNICAL/EmbASP).
